# FinLit: Personal Finance Education Tool

A simple Python tool that helps people understand basic financial concepts with cultural awareness.

## What This Is

I built this project to show how technology can make financial education more accessible. It's not fancy AI - it's practical math that anyone can understand.

## Why I Built It

During student debates about Pakistan's budget, I saw how financial policies affect real people. But I also saw that most people don't understand basic financial math. This tool is my attempt to solve that.

## What It Actually Does

### 1. **Basic Financial Calculators**
- Emergency fund calculator (different targets for Pakistan vs Italy)
- Savings goal tracker
- Debt payoff calculator
- Compound interest calculator

### 2. **Cultural Awareness**
- Pakistan: 6-month emergency fund, gold investment context
- Italy: 3-month emergency fund, student-specific advice
- Different budget templates for each country

### 3. **Educational Content**
- Simple financial lessons
- Country-specific tips
- Practical examples

## Technical Details

**It's simple on purpose:**
- Pure Python (no complex dependencies)
- One file (`finlit.py`) with everything
- Object-oriented but readable
- No external APIs or databases
- Just math and logic

**What's in the code:**
- `FinanceCalculator`: All the financial math
- `BudgetPlanner`: Creates sensible budgets
- `FinancialEducator`: Simple educational content
- `FinancialDashboard`: Text-based reporting
